# Java_AirportSimulator
This is a airport simulator.  The user will have to enter the number of turns to run the sim, the Queue size and the arrival/departure rate(a number between 0.1 and 0.9). Only 1 event can happen each turn and if the landig/departure que is full, the arriving planes will be turned away.
